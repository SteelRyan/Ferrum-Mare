# **Changelog**

Map
	Channels
		There exist 4 classic Channels
		Active from Gamestart:
			Channel #1 connecting "Sunda trench" and "Tusei Bank" via "Missolonghi"
			Channel #2 connecting "Northern Sumatra Trench" and "Moonless Seamounts" via "Jaffa"
		To be constructed by owner or spherelord:
			Channel #3 connecting "Central Indian Basin" and "Yekaterina Plains" via "Suwayda"
			Channel #4 connecting "Coast of Brunei" and "Coast of Annam" via "Sabara"

	Crossings
		All crossings are now market with a red stripe in the sea
		Additionally, any crossing split between two sea zones need to be blocked on both sides of a crossing is still possible

	New dual Channel-Crossing
		Via a specific combination of channels and crossings I was able to construct a new type of channel which I simply call a "Crossing-Channel"
		a "Crossing-Channel" can be understood according to two simple rules:
		1. To Channels has two provinces needed to close off the channel (one on each side)
			if only one of these provinces is occupied by either side then both sides can traverse it freely
		2. These provinces are always connected via a crossing (red stripe) and thus both sea sides of the "Crossing-Channel" have to be occupied by navy to stop army movement across
		
		TLDR: both sides of any component have to be controlled to allow movement or movement-suppression

		PS: If the controller of both sides of a channel is not allied with a nation, said nation cannot pass the channel even in peace time!

	Oil and Rubber spawn regions
		Both Oil and Rubber spawn is divided by regions which each allow a set number of Provinces with each of the resource,

		The Regions for Rubber are:
			Region 1: North-West Troida 
			Region 2: New World Sea 
			Region 3: East Servile Jungle and Jungle Adjacent
			Region 4: South Desperos

		The Regions for Oil are:
			Region 1: West Pillars
			Region 2: Central Pillars
			Region 3: East Pillars
			Region 4: North Desperos
			Region 5: South West Desperos
			Region 6: South East Desperos
			Region 7: South East Servile
			Region 8: South West Servile
			Region 9: Central Fidem
			Region 10: Central Troida
			Region 11: North Western Servile

		PS: I intend to make a decision for single-player that allows to showcase all the regions

	The Dark continent (Dynamic random pop)
		The host Nation has the ability to activate a dynamic randomizer on the pop in the colonizable regions of the Continent Servile
		Said pop are allocated according to:
		1: A randomized bonus between 13 subregions in which 4 have 20 more pop and 4 have 20% less pop
		2: Terrain

		This causes variation between the top states of the continent which I hope makes for a more interesting, varied and dynamic colonial contests

			gains a -15% research penatly for another 5 years then it can switch to a new tech school if the usuall conditions are met 

		Pergard
			The Pergardean Ethos of Progress
				Pergard gains: +5% Army Tech, +5% Commerce Tech, -15% Culture Tech, -15% Industry Tech, +15% Navy Tech.

	Unciv Rework
		There are four basic reform categories 1. Military, 2. Industrial, 3. Culture, 4. Special
		The only requirement for westernization is the completion of the industrial reforms (15 Reforms)
		Culture and Military reforms give their respective tier 1 techs and are alwas avalaiable but are not required
		The Special refroms are unlockable via "reform perks" which are sprinkled into the industrial reforms,
		after taking such a perk one may choose which special reform to unlock. 
		IMPORTANT! Most special reforms have a requirement indicated by the coored symbole at its right side!


	Tradeport mechanics
		There exist special Tradeport states across the map, owning no such state gives a -2% factory output modfier for each such owned state this penalty changes by +2% factory output.

	Pera unique CB
		A Unqiue CB only useable for all pea culture nations which targets any majority pera culture state for 
			48WS in 1836 to 1870
			24WS from 1870 onwards

		Additionally each seperate set of core CBS for 50% the cost
			24WS in 1836 to 1870
			12WS from 1870 onwards

		Any pera culture nation will instantly core a pera culture state taken with this CB or the transfeer state CB	


	Immigration
		The immigration in FM uses a completely new system, all nations are paired up in blocks of 4 which gain access to immigration and lose it again in every possible combination over a 6 year window. This effectively makes each immigration cycle a contest to now be the owrst performing nation amoung 4 peers in which one loses, however the end result is very well spread out.
		Additionally whenever a immigration nation is eliminated from the game its slots in the contests becomes non-competetive meaning any possible kill is always a benefit to ALL remaining immigration nations.



	Overseas imperium
		The Nation Verspodia and Trocia have a special interaction with the Continent of Troida (New world continent near the equator)
		both nations have a decision which upon activation grants any province of the continent Troida in the activators ownership a massive pop growth boost and a modifier causing internal migartion out of said province. additionally all cores of the acivator gain modifiers channeling the migration there. Effectively those two nation can for a limited amount of time gain a pop growth boost proportional to the amount of Troidan provinces they own.

	The second Rising
		The second Rising is an event which causes the Gardian nations to revolt against their oproessors (the neigbouring player nations)
		when the vent fires depends on the passage of time and the amount of event options taken by the neighbouring player nations which increase the gardian nationalism.
		This allows those 5 players to attempt to hasten or delay the event from firing (or to work against each other).
		After firing all gardian nation declare war on their repsective spherelord, the spherelord gain a free conquest cb on all of them in the process. This is meant to nullify the bufferzone between the player nation in the region and enter a sort of hot phase of the game since the option of reaching the "Concordance with the Gardian people" decision requirements becomes realistic from that point onwards.

	Doridian claims
		The nation of Doridia has a special start in the game,it has pockets of accepted pop across its borders, it is sorrounded by larger player nations and it has a large amount of cores at gamestart, these cores are however not premanent.
		Any core which the doridia palyer does not recoqnuer until the year 1850 will be removed, additionally one of 3 outcomes will be reached dependent on the amount of cores Doridia had reconquered.
		0 to 10 cores Reclaimed, Doridia loses 10 Prestige
		11 to 30 cores reclaimed, Doridia gains 50 Prestige
		30 to 40 cores reclaimed, all cores owned by Doridia gain 1 LR

	Redrogard sudden strike
		Redorgard gets access to a onetime instant CB on ANY of its ususal neighbouring player nations after finishing Nationalism and Imperialsim tech
