the_eternal_strife_over_adalsia_north_desc;the_eternal_strife_over_adalsia_north_desc;The states of Leda, Theyra, and Lusita have long stood independent in the center of the Adalsia Peninsula. Their position is vital to any power seeking dominance, and their steppes and mountains have produced resilient soldiers hardened by terrain and scarcity alike. To conquer them is to command the center and secure the keystone of the peninsula.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

form_AD2_title;Form the Adalsian Federation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_AD2_desc;Never before has Adalsia stood united. The peninsula’s rugged terrain and internal divisions long made unity a distant ideal rather than an attainable aim. Only with the arrival of modern technologies and political ideas did unification shift from fantasy to possibility. Today, the moment has come. The peninsula is secured under a single authority, its strategic position consolidated, and its future no longer left to fragmentation. The Adalsian Federation shall transform regional strength into national power, asserting itself not as a dream, but as a state capable of shaping the world it now stands ready to enter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

form_MI1_title;Reformation of Milogard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_MI1_desc;From the ruins of a thousand years of strife and the ashes of its final defeat, the Milogardian Empire rises once more. Crushed by a great coalition and splintered into independent duchies, the legacy of Milogard seemed destined for oblivion. Yet, through iron will and unyielding ambition, the disparate lands have been united again under a single banner, restoring the empire’s former glory.With its strength renewed, Milogard now turns its gaze outward, seeking retribution against the neighbors who once dismantled it, vowing to reclaim its rightful place as a dominant power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_FI1_title;Form The Union of Fidem;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_FI1_desc;The continent of Fidem has long lacked a power capable of shaping history on its own terms. Thinkers across its states once treated unity as theory, a subject for debate among elites and scholars rather than a goal within reach. Yet the idea persisted, that three rival powers, if forged into one, would become a nation capable not merely of enduring history, but of defining it. Said era of speculation has passed. The material means for unification now exist, and the political moment favors action over philosophy. What was once written as conjecture can at last be pursued as policy. To unite Fidem is no longer to imagine greatness, but to aknowledge the possibility of it. The Union of Fidem shall not merely inherit a chapter of history. It shall begin a new one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_ES6_title;Form Esdorea;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_ES6_desc;On the coasts of Servile, along the Central Sea, frontier settlers long sought a life beyond the reach of kings and their many laws. From these rough and isolated beginnings, a culture of autonomy, labor, and self-rule gave birth to several fiercely independent republics, shaped by desert, jungle, and rugged coastlines alike. Though divided in government, they remained united in language and shared values. Rivalry hardened them, but did not estrange them. Now the question is no longer survival, but ascendance. Should one republic rise to unite the rest, the continent would witness the birth of the first state forged by its own people, commanding both legitimacy and strength. A united Esdorea would not ask for greatness, it would declare it, and few could vanquish a nation created by the harsh frontier itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

reunite_the_white_coast_title;Reunite The White Coast;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reunite_the_white_coast_desc;Long ago, the White Coast was governed as one colonial dominion, united in name if not always in leadership. Independence fractured what ambition could not share. Pinaro forged a republic in the north, Hamero yielded to a singular presidential authority in the south, and Calero placed its future in the hands of a foreign elected king, a crown meant to preserve the unity of the center before rival powers unraveled it. Their mandates divided them, but the idea lived on. Born of the same origin, speaking the same language, and carrying the same legacy, they remained kin in spirit. Now the age of rivalry ends. The White Coast is whole again. Spherso inherits the restored authority of the fallen dominion. The White Coast stands united under one sovereign nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

form_pera_title;Form Empire of the Pera;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_pera_desc;200 years ago, the Pera was a region of feuding kingdoms, with shifting coalitions and ceaseless border disputes. This era ended abruptly with the Dohargard invasions, when the conquering hordes adopted the name Peragard and seized all Pera kingdoms by force, permanently destroying ever fortification in their way. Their rule was harsh, their taxes deeply resented, and open resistance seemingly impossible. Only the mountainous peninsulas held out. There, three surviving kingdoms preserved the Pera cause through guerrilla warfare, importing modern arms from abroad and enduring by patience rather than hope. In time, resistance became war, and war became liberation. Now the Peragard has been defeated. From victory rises a new and singular state: a united Pera authority, stronger and broader than any crown or coalition that came before it. The empire is proclaimed not as inheritance, but as the product of survival, resistance, and triumph. May it endure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Renowned for its wealth as a thriving trade hub, Maceria’s control of the narrow sea lanes offers unparalleled influence over commerce and military movements. Varan, an ambitious island nation with expansionist aims, seeks to bring Maceria under its dominion, securing dominance over the sea and protecting its interests from the growing threat of Luden. Meanwhile, Luden, a rising continental power on Troida, views Maceria as a gateway to securing its economic future and countering Varan’s maritime supremacy. This decision will determine the fate of the narrow sea: whether Varan solidifies its grip or Luden claims a hegemonical position. The future of the region hangs in the balance, as both powers prepare their gambits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

For centuries, its city-states prospered as economic conduits for the trade into the Pillars, giving rise to a distinct cultural identity shaped by a fusion of South Pillaren traditions. However, with the global decline of slavery, Namar’s wealth has withered, leaving its states fractured and embroiled in bitter internal rivalries. Seeking stability and protection, the embattled cities have turned to the great powers across the sea: Esperos and Trocia. Both nations, eager to expand their influence, have answered the call, vying for control of the region and its strategic position at the northern edge of Servile. This decision will determine the future of Namar. Will its fractured states find unity under the guidance of Esperos or Trocia, or will the contest for dominance plunge the region into further chaos? The struggle for Namar has begun, and the stakes are high for all involved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
