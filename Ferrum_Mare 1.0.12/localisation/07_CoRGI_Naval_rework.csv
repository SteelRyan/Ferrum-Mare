transport_shipyard_desc;Clippers are fast vessels with three masts and a square rig. They are generally narrow for their length, can carry limited bulk freight and have a large total sail area. Optimized for speed, they are too fine-lined to carry much cargo. Clippers typically carry extra sails such as skysails and moonrakers on the masts and studdingsails on booms extending out from the hull or yards, which required extra hands to handle them. §YThis dockyard supports the following ships: Clipper Transports, Steamer Transports.§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;,
late_shipyard_desc;The key innovation that revolutionized the construction of pre-dreadnought and dreadnought battleships was the transition from paddle-wheels to screw propellers for propulsion. These ships had steam engines designed to deliver power directly to the propeller shaft at the base of the machinery. The shaft extended through the hull to the stern tube, driving the screw propeller. To manage the motive force transmitted along the shaft, a thrust bearing was essential, ensuring the load was transferred without causing excessive friction. §YThis dockyard supports the following ships: Battleships, Dreadnoughts.§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;,
steamer_shipyard_desc;The key innovation that made steamers viable is the change from the paddle-wheel to the screw-propeller for propulsion. Steam engines are designed with the power delivered at the bottom of the machinery, to give direct drive to the propeller shaft, where it passes to the stern tube through the hull. Since the motive power of screw propulsion is delivered along the shaft, a thrust bearing is needed to transfer that load without excessive friction. §YThis dockyard supports the following ships: Ironclads, Monitors, Cruisers.§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
